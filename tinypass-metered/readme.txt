Tinypass is the best way to charge for access to content on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Tinypass is a simple, powerful plugin that allows any online publisher to easily sell access to any type of content, whether it's a blog post, a site subscription, a digital download, or even a pay-per-view video. Tinypass can accept payments as small as **2 cents ($0.02)**, supports **24 currencies**, and doesn't require changing your site's existing structure or layout. We make it easy to charge for content! 

Any site, large or small, can use Tinypass to easily build a new revenue stream from paid content. And while you're still free to earn money from advertising anywhere on your site, we've seen that a simple paid content plan can quickly surpass what you can earn from advertising, even if you're only selling access to a small percentage of your site's content. And since it doesn't cost anything to get started with Tinypass, we make it easy to experiment with charging for content.  

You can use Tinypass to **charge for access to a single post or a bundle of posts**. There are no merchant accounts to create, and no hoops to jump through when it comes to getting paid. 

Selling content is **easy** with Tinypass. Just create a free publisher account at Tinypass.com, download our plugin, then decide what content you want to charge for. In minutes you can start to sell access on a per-post basis, or use our simple tagging method to build a subscription plan, offer tiers of membership, bundles of content, or simply sell access to the occasional "premium" post. 

And for your visitors, buying access to content through Tinypass couldn't be easier. We offer a **wide choice of payment methods**, we don't require your visitors to create an account before making a purchase, and all transactions happen in a quick, secure environment. Gone are the days of clunky shopping carts and confusing checkouts!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Tinypass? =

Tinypass is a flexible, powerful, enterprise-grade tool for selling access to any kind of digital content. We enable publishers and content creators to charge in any amount, on their own sites, with pricing rules that they control.

For WordPress, we offer a customized interface in your WordPress dashboard that takes all the hard work out of charging for access to your content. Whether you're using Tinypass to protect a blog post, charge for a pay-per-view video, or monetize your photography website, Tinypass offers a simple system for selling content that works seamlessly with WordPress. 

= So it's like a paywall? = 

We don't love the term "paywall", because it implies a binary either-you-pay-or-you're-locked-out paradigm, and Tinypass enables much more sophisticated pricing models, but it is a common industry term. So if a paywall is what you're looking for, we have lots of satisfied publishers who use Tinypass for exactly that! 

= How do I use Tinypass? =

You can deploy Tinypass in one of two ways: either you can use one of our existing plug-ins for popular CMS platforms (Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla are currently available, with more on the way), or you can use our API to integrate Tinypass into another existing system. Currently we offer libraries for Java, .NET, and PHP.

But since you're looking at Tinypass for WordPress, here's how it works: Just create a free publisher account at Tinypass.com, download our plugin, then decide what content you want to charge for. In minutes you can start to sell access on a per-post basis. Just use the simple WordPress dashboard interface to set a preview, a price, an access period, and you're done! OR, you can use our simple tagging method to build a subscription plan, offer tiers of membership, bundles of content, or simply sell access to the occasional "premium" post. 

The Tinypass plugin was designed to sell content in a way that makes sense for WordPress, and there's no need to work with any of the code if you don't want to.
