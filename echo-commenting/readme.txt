Echo is a next-generation real-time commenting system that replaces the Wordpress commenting system.

== Description ==

Echo is the next generation commenting system. It's the way to share your content, and watch the live reaction. You can quickly embed Echo on WordPress, Blogger, or any website and turn your static pages into a real-time stream of diggs, tweets, comments and more.

This plugin enables seamless integration with Echo by exporting existing WordPress comments into Echo and instantly synchronizing new comments to your wordpress database. It will automatically replace your wordpress comments once activated.
